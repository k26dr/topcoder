Topcoder
========

Python solutions to TopCoder problems. I needed some proof of my Python and algorithm skills for interviews.  
If anyone finds these useful, than that's an added bonus. 

The problem name is the title and all files have a header in format {Match-Type} ###, R#D#L#.   
Example: MagicWords.py is SRM 433 R1D1L1
